Larger Batch sizes result in better peformance
Smaller batch sizes result in overfitting, and therefore require a smaller learning rate and fewer epochs of training

Increased LSTM layers have an adverse effect on performance. This may be because the data is of a single dimension (time)
    - consider concurrently looking at 50 at a time
    
Performance increases with more hidden parameters (10 is the best)
